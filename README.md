# Machine Learning Classification: KNN vs. Decision Tree

### 📌 Project Overview
This repository contains a complete implementation and comparative analysis of two fundamental Supervised Machine Learning algorithms: **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** and **Decision Tree Classifier**. The project demonstrates the end-to-end process of building a classification model using Python and Scikit-Learn.

### 🚀 Key Features
* **Data Preprocessing:** Handling data and preparing features for training.
* **Feature Scaling:** Implementation of `StandardScaler` to normalize data distribution (essential for KNN performance).
* **Model Training:** Training both KNN and Decision Tree models on the dataset.
* **Performance Evaluation:** Comparing the models to determine the most effective approach for the given problem.

### 🛠️ Technologies Used
* **Python**
* **Scikit-Learn (sklearn)**
* **Pandas & NumPy**
* **Matplotlib / Seaborn** (for visualization)

### 📂 Project Workflow
1.  **Data Loading & Exploration:** Understanding the dataset structure.
2.  **Preprocessing:** transform raw data into a format suitable for modeling.
3.  **Scaling:** Applying standard scaling to ensure features contribute equally to the distance calculations in KNN.
4.  **Model Fitting:** Training the algorithms on the training set.
5.  **Prediction & Evaluation:** Testing the models on unseen data and analyzing the results.
